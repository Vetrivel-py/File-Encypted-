# File-Encrypted-

## About the GUI App
This is a simple GUI app that Encrypt/Decrpyt a local file in your PC.
I have used a simple formula to encrypt each characters in the file, and create a new file with the encrpyted data in it. Similarly, you can decrpyt, it decrpyts the file and 
stores it in a new file and deletes the old one.
I have created a simple GUI using tkinter (a python package) to create the user interface (Simple GUI) that allows users to select the to whether encrypt or decrpyt a file and
to choose the loaction of the source file using a file expolerer.

## How to Run

*Run this command (Make sure that you are in the dir of App.py)*
```python App.py ```

**Select your choice, whether Encrypt/Decrypt**
**Choose the source file**
**Open the source file to see the result**
