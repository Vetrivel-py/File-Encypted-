# File-Encrypted-

## About the GUI App
This is a simple GUI app that Encrypts/Decrpyts a local file in your PC.

I have used ***Symmetric Encryption*** to encrypt the file, and create a new file with the encrpyted data in it. Similarly, you can decrpyt the file.

I have created a simple GUI using tkinter (a python package) to create the user interface (Simple GUI) that allows users to select the to whether encrypt or decrpyt a file and
to choose the loaction of the source file using a file expolerer.

## How to Run

*Run this command (Make sure that you are in the dir of App.py)*

```python App.py ```

**Select your choice, whether Encrypt/Decrypt**

**Choose the source file**

**Open the source file to see the result**
